# SQL Data Analysis: Digital Book Platform Insights
**Professional Context**

- Program: TripleTen Data Analyst Bootcamp.

- Standards: Developed as a professional-grade database analysis designed to extract actionable business intelligence from complex relational structures.

- Quality Assurance: The SQL architecture and data retrieval logic were built to ensure high-performance queries and data accuracy, meeting industry standards for analytical reporting.

**Executive Summary**

This project analyzes the behavior and catalog structure of a digital book platform using advanced SQL queries. By examining book performance, publisher output, and user engagement metrics, I provided a strategic overview of the platform's current state. The analysis identified key growth drivers, such as high-engagement "power users" and top-performing authors like J.K. Rowling, to inform future product development and marketing alliances.

**Technical Stack**

- Languages: SQL (PostgreSQL), Python 3.9.

- Libraries: Pandas, SQLAlchemy.

- Methodology: Relational Database Querying, Data Aggregation, Multi-table Joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for complex logic.

**Key Results**

- Catalog Vitality: Identified 819 books published after January 1, 2000, confirming the platform maintains a modern and relevant title selection.

- Strategic Partners: Determined Penguin Books as the leading contributor of substantial content (42 titles with >50 pages), identifying them as a primary candidate for future business collaborations.

- Author Performance: Validated J.K. Rowling as the top-rated author (4.29 average rating) among titles with high statistical significance (50+ ratings).

- User Loyalty: Discovered that highly active users—those who rate 50+ books—write an average of 24.33 text reviews, indicating a deeply committed community that can be leveraged for organic platform growth.

**Language Note**

The technical documentation, conclusions, and code comments in the accompanying .ipynb file are written in Spanish, as the original project requirements and database context were provided in that language.
